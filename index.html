                    To many the Web is a mystery that can only be unlocked by a <em>nerd</em>. But how the Web works can be quite facinating for most people. Basically it's a huge network of computers talking to each other. When you request a web page your computer sends a request to a server that sends the requested document. 
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The problem is that computers don't speak English. The main language for the Web is HTML (Hypertext Markup Language). HTTP is the "grammer" of the Web. Urls are the addresses for the pages and files you are looking for. The Web was created in the early 1990's. It currently has about 30 billion pages.

                  HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup
                  Language.</em> HTML documents form the majority of the
                  content on the web. HTML is made up of:

                <ol>
                  <li>Text Content - What you see</li>
                  <li>Markup - What it looks like</li>
                  <li>References to other documents e.g. images and videos</li>
                  <li>Links to other pages</li>

                  HTML documents are made of HTML
                  <b>elements</b>. An element is made up of an opening tag, contents (the information you want to convey), and  a closing tag. The opening tag can also contain attributes that assist in coding and style.

                  Spock is very logical and also very literal. Agonozingly so. Computers are just like that. Computers don't like mistakes. Everything has to be exactly as the computer wants it or you get ugly error messages back. Computers like to remind us that we're human - just like Spock! Therefore, Spock must be a <em><b>COMPUTER</b></em>.

                </ol>
                <p>
                  On the other hand, other tags are strickly inline. Like for instance the <em>span</em> tag.

                These are the "tools" that help developers write code quicker and easier. If you're going to get that HTML "treed" you need the best tools you can get! I look forward to adding many others to this list as we go along
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>Scratchpad - great for the quick and dirty coding work</li>
                <li>Sublime Text - Awesome tool for coding.</li>
                <li>CodePen - My favorite. Great tool for seeing how changes to the code change the page.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                I'm also excited to see that CodePen has the ability to validate my CSS with LINT without going through an additional step!!

                When it comes to HTML, being in the box is a good thing. Some HTML elements can contain many other HTML elements which in turn can contain many other elements, and so on, and so on... 
              </p>
              <p>
                This nesting of boxes gives structure to the code and lends itself to the "tree" analogy. Personally, I think you need a few if/then/else statements before things start "branching" out.

              <p>
                  If you are doing a good job of writing code then you indent as you go deeper into the "nested boxes". The greater the indentation, the deeper in the "nested boxes" you are. If you don't indent when you write code then good luck figuring out what you have or debugging it! You will end up getting Lost in Space....

                <p>
                   No one likes to write or read the same code over and over. It's boring and it takes up time and space. More than that it means more errors and more debugging. Even more, what happens when your boss says he wants a differnt font used - and it's in fifty places in your code!! HTML has an answer for that - 
                </p>
                <p>
                    DEFINE CLASSES. This keeps you from repeating code over and over. If you need to make a change then it happens once in the class definition. I think that's what Object Oriented Programming is all about.....

                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is what makes HTMl look good. This is a seperate language that addresses all the style issues that HTML has. The HTML must link to the corresponding CSS file. This gives the programmer the ability to change the way a page looks without changing any HTML. It also greatly assists in creating a common "theme" among related webpages.
